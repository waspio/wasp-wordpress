This plugin automatically grabs all errors created by WordPress, Wordpress plugins, and Wordpress Themes and notifies you in realtime.


== Description ==

This plugin is designed to handle errors outside of the ordinary errors thrown by Wordpress plugins, Wordpress, and any other code within your wordpress website.

**You must have a [Wasp.io](https://wasp.io/) account in order to use this plugin.  Sign up for free, no credit card needed**

Wasp.io automatically tracks errors generated by your applications, intelligently notifies your team, and provides realtime data feeds of errors and activity for all of your websites.


== Installation ==

1. Install Wasp either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server
2. After activating Wasp from the 'Plugins' menu in Wordpress, you need to sign up at [https://wasp.io](https://wasp.io/) for an API Key.

4. That's it.  Wasp will now automatically track your errors!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get a Wasp API key? =

Once you have a Wasp.io account, and have created a project, navigate to the project settings, and your API key will be shown there.

= Why should I use Wasp? =

Errors slow down, and can take down your websites, and often the only notification you get is from a panicking client, or a visitor nice enough to let you know; Wasp.io automatically overrides the default error handling of your Wordpress (or other) sites, and sends those errors (including fatal errors) to the WaspAPI for grouping, filtering, and notification in realtime.
